# wp-starter-theme
A starting point for WordPress theme development based on WP Twenty-Seventeen
It uses the following grunt workflows for: -
gruntwatch - Watch development directories and does the following ...tbc
gruntdist - Builds and minifies theme and assets and creates a shippable dist directory

The starter template uses Foundation for Sites - primarily for grid and blockgrid (although other libraries can be used)

Sass is the CSS parsing engine and by default we use:-
css_reset
normalize
foundation/components grid
foundation/components block-grid
